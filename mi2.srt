1
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,807
Well, Dimitri,
every search for a hero

2
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:03,559
must begin with something
that every hero requires...

3
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,520
a villain.

4
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,404
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

5
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:14,328
we created a monster...

6
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,848
Chimera.

7
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:21,686
I beg you, Dimitri,

8
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:25,324
come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta. Immediately.

9
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,166
However we travel,

10
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,566
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

11
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,403
We're two and a half hours
from Atlanta.

12
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:08,078
Right now, we have a great view
of the Rocky Mountains.

13
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,168
You stare at that watch as if
your life depended on it, Doctor.

14
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,441
Yes, I suppose I'm a bit anxious.

15
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,923
You'll soon be with old friends.

16
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,483
I'm with an old friend now, Dimitri.

17
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,087
I'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.

18
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,565
I'm sorry, too.
You are sorry and I'm sorry.

19
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:37,127
You don't know Gradski
thought the world of you.

20
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:43,005
Did he... know... before the end
that you two had succeeded?

21
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,643
Yes, he knew. Just.

22
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:51,006
- Not in time to save him?
- No.

23
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,722
After you've been infected
with Chimera

24
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:56,283
for 20 hours, nothing can save you.

25
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,524
Not even Bellerophon.

26
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,202
You can carry them together?

27
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,446
- Safely?
- Yes.

28
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,244
And you'll get us to a safe place
in Atlanta, thank God.

29
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,722
This is your Captain again.

30
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,363
We've experienced a slight
but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.

31
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,288
As a precaution,
I've released the oxygen masks.

32
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,368
Put them on, relax,
there's nothing to worry about.

33
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,526
Are you concerned?

34
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,127
Not so far.

35
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,286
Put on your oxygen mask,
I'll see what's going on.

36
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:45,322
Denver Centre,
this is Trans-Pac 2207, 747 heavy.

37
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,524
We're unable to maintain
cabin pressurisation.

38
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,118
We've initiated a descent
to one-six-thousand.

39
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,841
Captain...

40
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,201
God...

41
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,602
It seems we have a problem, Dimitri.

42
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,085
You keep calling me Dimitri.

43
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,848
You really shouldn't.

44
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,959
You're not Dimitri?

45
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,963
No.

46
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,967
Wallace, hold on to this.

47
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,247
Ulrich, remember to dump the...

48
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:20,124
Remember to dump the NO2 tank.

49
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,160
All done, chief.

50
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,963
Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up.

51
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,923
Checkpoint Charlie
in three... two... one... Go!

52
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:50,684
Terrain. Terrain. Pull up. Pull up.

53
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,481
Terrain. Terrain.

54
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,918
Pull up. Pull up.

55
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,398
Good morning, Mr Hunt. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

56
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:19,124
involves recovery of a stolen item
designated "Chimera".

57
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,046
You may select any two team members

58
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,638
but the third team member
must be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.

59
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:29,046
She is a civilian and a highly
capable professional thief.

60
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,728
You have 48 hours
to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall

61
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,408
and meet me in Seville
to receive your assignment.

62
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,044
As always, should you or any member
of your IM Force be caught,

63
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,365
the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of you.

64
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:46,005
And next time you go on holiday
let us know where.

65
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,046
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

66
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,605
If I let you know where I'm going,
then I won't be on holiday.

67
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,391
I see you found it.

68
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:29,949
- What are you doing here?
- Think only you can pick locks?

69
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,584
Not just a pretty face after all.

70
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,229
Do you mind if I'm on top?

71
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:57,391
No, either way works for me.

72
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,988
- You'll never find it there.
- Damnit!

73
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,467
- Find what?
- His ex's Bulgari necklace

74
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,550
that goes up for auction on Tuesday.

75
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,670
Are you going to tell me where it is?

76
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,510
Far left.

77
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,388
This is very disconcerting.

78
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:58,222
You put me here.
I just do as I'm told.

79
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:00,667
Right.

80
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:30,274
Now, who are you -
and what's it gonna cost me?

81
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,430
- I wouldn't do that.
- What?

82
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,673
That.

83
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,184
No, no. Tranquilos. Tranquilos.

84
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:47,304
Mr Keys, it is you.

85
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,426
It is Mr Keys, our security engineer!
Apologise!

86
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:52,829
No, no need to apologise.

87
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,991
My associate
has your necklace in a safe place,

88
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,912
but the alarms
should have gone off sooner.

89
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:01,866
Isn't that right, Miss Hall?

90
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:05,509
Absolutely.
Much, much too long, I'd say.

91
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:12,111
We'd recommend resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.

92
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:16,272
- How do you feel about 40 kilos?
- Perfect.

93
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,187
Shall we?

94
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:25,826
Miss Hall...

95
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:28,183
Haven't you forgotten something?

96
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:35,227
What are you trying to do,
senorita-rob me?

97
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:38,107
The thought had crossed my mind.

98
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:43,465
I'm missing something here -
apart from my necklace.

99
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:46,711
- I could have walked out with it.
- At least you walked.

100
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:49,951
Why didn't you stop me
going through with it?

101
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,543
To see how good you were.
I hope we can work together.

102
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,586
Sounds terrific. Muchacho.

103
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:03,393
Be serious. You couldn't possibly
want me after tonight's performance.

104
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,868
- You did OK.
- You apologising for me?

105
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:08,951
Quite the gentleman. Gracias.

106
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,428
Not really...

107
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:13,544
I triggered the alarm.

108
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:18,073
Sorry.

109
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:26,073
I don't do laundry,
cook or put up with cheeky bastards

110
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,947
who set me up
to poach on my territory.

111
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,507
Hello?

112
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:56,705
Hi. Would you mind slowing down?

113
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,912
Where'd you get this number?
I don't even have it.

114
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,669
Would you like it?

115
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,869
- Pull over and listen to me.
- Listen to what?

116
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:31,190
I need your help
and you could use mine.

117
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,623
Your help?
What are you talking about?

118
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:38,111
I'm talking about Scotland Yard,
Interpol, every Dutch authority.

119
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,873
I can make them all go away.

120
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,587
Bloody hell. You're a spy?

121
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:47,383
If you want me,
you've got to catch me!

122
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,271
Having fun?

123
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,313
Sorry.

124
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,111
Idiota!

125
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:32,507
Sorry!

126
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,351
Watch the road! Watch the road!

127
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:40,349
What's your name?

128
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:45,514
- Ethan Hunt.
- Well, Ethan Hunt...

129
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:49,263
what is it you want
to talk to me about?

130
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,111
A lot more than I thought.

131
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:57,349
Awfully short notice.

132
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:00,431
Care to wait a decent interval?

133
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:02,624
Who wants to be decent?

134
00:21:57,194 --> 00:22:00,152
So what have you got against spies?

135
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,584
When they've got your
recruiting technique... not a thing.

136
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,670
This wasn't exactly by the book.

137
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:10,786
- They've got a book for this?
- For everything.

138
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:14,784
So this thing these blokes pinched...

139
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,553
I don't know that they pinched it.

140
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:19,312
I don't even know they're blokes.

141
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,985
Then what am I doing here?

142
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:29,631
I thought I was
some sort of thief to catch a thief.

143
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:33,508
So do I. Sort of.

144
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:42,744
Damn, you're beautiful.

145
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:58,012
- Espresso? Cappuccino?
- No, thanks.

146
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:01,650
Sit down...
Festival's a pain in the ass -

147
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:04,414
honouring their saints
by setting them on fire.

148
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,571
That's what they think of saints.

149
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,573
Damn near set me on fire coming over.

150
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:16,129
- Sorry I interrupted your vacation.
- Sorry I didn't say where I was.

151
00:24:16,175 --> 00:24:20,646
- It's not a vacation if you did.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry.

152
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:26,131
- Why did you phrase it like that?
- Like what?

153
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:27,972
"You're sorry. I'm sorry."

154
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,127
You gotta be kidding?

155
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:42,289
Well, Dimitri,
once again I need your help,

156
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,974
just as in the old days, eh?

157
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:48,371
When you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.

158
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:56,484
Dimitri, we have...
this little problem.

159
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,333
Every search for a hero

160
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,572
must begin with something
that every hero requires...

161
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,731
a villain.

162
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:09,166
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

163
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:11,649
we created a monster...

164
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,209
Chimera.

165
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,610
I beg you, Dimitri,

166
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:21,046
come to Sydney and accompany me
to Atlanta. Immediately.

167
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:22,767
However we travel,

168
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:27,605
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

169
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:32,683
I fear I can entrust this
to no one but you.

170
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:38,287
Dimitri, as we say,
I'm sorry and you are sorry.

171
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:40,690
You have any idea what he means?

172
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:43,613
- Any idea? Yeah.
- Like?

173
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:48,285
Pick him up quickly,
but not on a commercial carrier.

174
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,246
Is he still in Sydney?

175
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,855
Dr Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.

176
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,933
So is Gradski,
but that happened earlier.

177
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:59,569
We had Nekhorvich on a flight
from Sydney

178
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:02,334
that crashed in the Rockies.

179
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,173
- Dead...
- Are you listening to me?

180
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:11,053
If he didn't want
to go anywhere without me...

181
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:13,051
how did you get him on that flight?

182
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:15,165
You were there.

183
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,529
When I couldn't find you
I had to replace you.

184
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,531
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.

185
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:28,770
He's doubled you two or three times.

186
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:33,851
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

187
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:40,804
We had reservations about each other.
It's a little late for that.

188
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:45,007
No, not necessarily.
Airline records...

189
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:49,094
list a Captain Harold Mackintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.

190
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:52,571
As far as the media
and government agencies are concerned

191
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:55,527
Captain Mackintosh
died in the flight.

192
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,964
But in fact he missed it.

193
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:02,213
He did, however,
make the next flight... in cargo.

194
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:06,407
Stuffed into a rather small
suitcase-considering his size.

195
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:11,768
Someone brought the plane down
and made it look like an accident,

196
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:16,331
someone skillful enough
to bring it off without a hitch.

197
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,286
There's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.

198
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:23,011
You do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?

199
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:26,252
Sean likes to leave
a lot of hats on the ground.

200
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,445
The question is why.

201
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:31,931
What was this Chimera
Nekhorvich was carrying?

202
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,693
Only Ambrose knows that.

203
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:39,367
In any case, you must recover
this Chimera and bring it to us.

204
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:44,331
I have to figure out
how he'll make money with it.

205
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,570
That is where Miss Hall comes in.

206
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,367
Excuse me?

207
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:55,851
She and Ambrose had a relationship
which he took seriously,

208
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:58,568
she walked away
and he's always wanted her back.

209
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:01,846
We believe she's our surest way
of locating him.

210
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:05,854
- And then what?
- She continues to see him,

211
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,205
gets him to confide in her
and report to you.

212
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:26,527
You made it sound as if
I was recruiting her

213
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,566
for her skills as a thief.

214
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:32,324
I misled you
or you made the wrong assumption,

215
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:36,288
either way we are asking her
to resume a prior relationship -

216
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:42,171
nothing she hasn't already done.
Voluntarily, I might add.

217
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:45,332
No... she's got no training for this.

218
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,684
Go to bed with a man and lie to him?

219
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:50,533
She's a woman.
She's got all the training she needs.

220
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,490
I don't think I can get her to do it.

221
00:28:58,535 --> 00:29:00,924
- You mean it'll be difficult?
- Very.

222
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,933
This is not Mission: Difficult,
it's Mission: lmpossible.

223
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,772
Difficult should be easy for you.

224
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:09,171
If you have a quicker way
to get to Ambrose,

225
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:12,366
you're welcome to try.
Take a look at these

226
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:16,203
if you have any qualms
about getting her to do the job.

227
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:14,694
How many people are capable
of something like that?

228
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:21,092
Sean Ambrose... for one.

229
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:29,491
Right.

230
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:41,649
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.

231
00:30:45,295 --> 00:30:47,286
But it's what you'd like me to do.

232
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:54,813
What? Let my conscience be my guide.

233
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:57,130
- Is that it?
- Something like that.

234
00:30:57,175 --> 00:31:00,326
I don't have conscience,
I'm a bloody thief!

235
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,686
You gonna try and force me?

236
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,930
I don't favour coercing someone

237
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,284
when my life could be in their hands.

238
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,886
Is that the only reason?

239
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:16,290
- Got a better one?
- Me? No!

240
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:20,567
But I hoped you might think this
got personal as well as physical!

241
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:23,652
OK. Would you feel better
if I didn't like this?

242
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:26,004
- Yeah, much!
- Then feel better!

243
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:07,489
Sean will be suspicious if
I turn up and say "Honey, I'm home!"

244
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:13,093
- What wouldn't make him suspicious?
- That I needed him urgently.

245
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,853
Destitute. In serious trouble,

246
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,204
the kind I couldn't sort out myself.

247
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:24,648
Serious trouble, Nyah...

248
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,925
is something I can always arrange.

249
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:34,007
This transponder chip
is completely untraceable.

250
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:38,131
It transmits your location
to a satellite,

251
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:41,167
which can be read
by only this computer.

252
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:45,003
We can then track you
to within three feet. Anywhere.

253
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:48,968
Since your arrest

254
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:52,087
I've been sending news bulletins
to every law enforcement agency.

255
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,888
I know Sean Ambrose.

256
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:58,007
And I guarantee
that after that airline crash,

257
00:32:58,055 --> 00:33:02,287
he's monitoring every one.
He knows you're there.

258
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:06,010
And he has the means to get you out.

259
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:09,644
Nyah...

260
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:15,245
Nyah...

261
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,570
I'm not gonna lose you.

262
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:16,807
Ethan Hunt? G'day, mate,
I'm William Baird, but Billy's OK.

263
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,369
Anything you need getting,
I'm your man.

264
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:21,406
I'll have a look around.

265
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,724
- Shit.
- Yes, it is.

266
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:31,807
This ain't funny.

267
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:35,006
I just bought these $800 Gucci shoes

268
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:38,047
and you got me
in a helicopter with this man?

269
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,133
Computer's up. You got him.

270
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,006
Let's get a visual.

271
00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:45,733
- Visuals aren't coming up.
- The satellite isn't as fast as me.

272
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:47,970
I heard about you, Luther.

273
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:51,803
It's an honour
to be working with you blokes.

274
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:58,969
Isn't there a way to speed this up?

275
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,404
With what? This is
the only computer that'll do this.

276
00:36:58,695 --> 00:37:00,413
Ethan, here we go.

277
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:13,852
There's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.

278
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:19,248
Don't get me wrong, mate,
you were very friendly also.

279
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,566
- That him?
- It's him.

280
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,288
- We've got him!
- We don't know what we've got.

281
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:28,771
We don't know what he's got,
where he's got it

282
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:31,409
or what he's doing in Sydney with it.

283
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:41,523
- Not much luggage.
- I left in a bit of a hurry.

284
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,611
I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.

285
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:47,131
How in the world did you find me?

286
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,531
How I usually find you, Nyah...

287
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:53,972
Magic.

288
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,965
No flies on her. No bugs either.

289
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:18,087
No transmissions-she's clean.

290
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:20,285
All cats are.

291
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:29,484
Your room?

292
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:34,287
And my room?

293
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,929
She did it.

294
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:57,366
- She's in the compound.
- Yeah?

295
00:38:57,415 --> 00:39:01,931
We've just rolled up a snowball
and tossed it into hell.

296
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:04,250
Now we'll see what chance it has.

297
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,926
Try it on.

298
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:12,965
Go ahead.

299
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:22,565
I'm dying to see
if I remembered your size.

300
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:53,127
You're not interested
in seeing how it looks?

301
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,325
I am...

302
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:00,012
Later.

303
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,689
Every search for a hero
must begin with something

304
00:40:25,735 --> 00:40:29,614
that every hero requires...
a villain.

305
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:33,887
Therefore, in the search
for our hero, Bellerophon,

306
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:38,008
we created a monster... Chimera.

307
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:40,489
Nekhorvich was a molecular biologist,

308
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:42,651
why is he going on
about an old Greek myth?

309
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:46,768
Nekhorvich specialised
in recombining DNA molecules.

310
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:53,647
In the myth, Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera,

311
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:57,051
a monster with the head of a lion

312
00:40:57,095 --> 00:40:59,928
and the tail of a serpent,

313
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,092
that plagued the ancient world.

314
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:07,174
I think Nekhorvich
created a monster virus in Chimera.

315
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,605
And the anti-virus to kill it
in Bellerophon.

316
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:15,845
That simple, huh?

317
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:17,851
Why not?

318
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:38,251
£37 million.

319
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,526
That's a promising bid
for Nekhorvich's work.

320
00:41:43,175 --> 00:41:46,167
Don't look so worried, Hugh,
we're halfway there.

321
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:51,966
We'll need this at the track...

322
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:55,566
if we're gonna get the other half.

323
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:08,483
Well, then... sorted.

324
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:17,166
Not everything.

325
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:21,291
Why do you think she's really here?

326
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,485
From her point of view or mine?

327
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:28,333
She wasn't exactly gagging for it

328
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,445
when she left you six months ago.

329
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:35,848
The question is, do you trust her?

330
00:42:43,415 --> 00:42:45,246
One considers her timing, of course.

331
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:48,765
Getting nicked within a week
of the plane going down.

332
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:52,774
Suggestive,
even borderline suspicious.

333
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:56,046
But hardly conclusive.

334
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,170
You've thought about it, anyway.

335
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:11,255
Tell me, Hugh,

336
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:14,651
you don't exactly hang on Nyah's
every word and gesture, do you?

337
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:20,530
That's a fairly ratty nail.

338
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,249
Sean, please...

339
00:43:26,295 --> 00:43:30,004
Suppose she is
some sort of Trojan Horse

340
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:32,615
sent in by IMF to spy on us?

341
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:35,852
Why should I deny myself
the pleasure of a ride?

342
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:40,607
Don't you think I can learn more
from her than she can from me?

343
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:43,123
I do! I do! I do!

344
00:43:45,575 --> 00:43:48,567
Now, Hugh, you must realise

345
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:51,766
that some of us have the burden
of sex to deal with.

346
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:55,490
I may not know
why she thinks she's here,

347
00:43:55,535 --> 00:43:58,493
but I want to take the risk.
Because, Hugh...

348
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:02,606
I am gagging for it.

349
00:44:24,172 --> 00:44:25,844
Come on! Come on!

350
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:33,723
- Darling! You won!
- I suppose I did.

351
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,560
Why'd you pick that nag?
He's never won a thing.

352
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:40,001
"Thief In The Night".

353
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,805
Say no more. I'm...

354
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:48,570
I'm going to grab a drink.
You still favour the Bellinis?

355
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:06,890
Naturally vain.

356
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:11,330
- Pardon me?
- Naturally Vain.

357
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:15,486
In the fourth.
Check her out, she's due.

358
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:19,687
Put this in your ear.

359
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:32,682
You can speak
as if I'm right by your side.

360
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,131
Where are you?

361
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,130
The mounting enclosure,
just off the track. Two o'clock.

362
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:55,565
- How's it going?
- Just like old times.

363
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:00,967
- Just like old times?
- Just about.

364
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:06,684
Tell me who you've run into
at Ambrose's?

365
00:46:06,732 --> 00:46:10,771
I think there's about a half dozin
other blokes about the place.

366
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,040
Maybe more.

367
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:16,324
Hugh Stamp, old friend of Sean's,
is the only one I recognise.

368
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:18,203
A creep and then some.

369
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:21,483
We know him,
he's looking at you right now.

370
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:27,249
Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.

371
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:29,487
37 million on the London Times.

372
00:46:29,532 --> 00:46:31,762
What's that about?

373
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:35,162
Bids from possible Chimera buyers.

374
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:48,604
Ambrose is meeting
some bloke in the bar.

375
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:52,122
Big bloke, ginger hair.
They're into something.

376
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:00,721
- Who is this guy?
- Checking now.

377
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:11,282
John McCloy, CEO,
Biocyte Pharmaceuticals.

378
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:14,404
In 1989, acquired Biocyte
in a hostile take-over.

379
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:18,966
- He was Nekhorvich's boss.
- Right.

380
00:47:19,012 --> 00:47:21,321
He worked
as a researcher at Biocyte.

381
00:47:23,052 --> 00:47:26,931
Ambrose is showing something
to McCloy on a digital camera.

382
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:30,248
Whatever McCloy's looking at,
he's not happy about it.

383
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:43,682
Ambrose just put the camera's
memory card into an envelope.

384
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:48,322
It's in his inner-left jacket pocket.

385
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:50,567
Confirm, left-jacket pocket.

386
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,529
Roger that.

387
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:59,288
Nyah, Ambrose is on his way back.

388
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:03,120
- There's an envelope inside...
...his left jacket pocket.

389
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,446
That's right.

390
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:07,848
- Where do I meet you?
- Betting table 12.

391
00:48:07,892 --> 00:48:11,362
- Sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.

392
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:15,207
- There you are!
- See anything you like?

393
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:18,449
Well, yeah... Naturally Vain.

394
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:21,609
They're closing the betting
and I haven't a bean!

395
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:24,212
- Nyah...
- Would you mind terribly?

396
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:30,009
Not at all, but you are gonna
pay for it-and with interest.

397
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:32,282
I have no doubt.

398
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:35,129
Hold on.

399
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,644
Put down a thousand for me.

400
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,611
- To win?
- What else?

401
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:01,369
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.

402
00:49:01,412 --> 00:49:03,050
No worries, mate.

403
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:07,290
Luther, digital camera,
ready to transmit, betting table 12.

404
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,160
- How'd you get on?
- Good, thanks.

405
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:29,247
Sorry about that, mate,
that must've...

406
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,364
Say again?

407
00:49:32,412 --> 00:49:34,767
Wherever you're about in future,
watch your step.

408
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:36,803
Never know who you'll run into.

409
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:41,765
So where's the loo?

410
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,643
Thanks, mate.

411
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:02,166
This is a big field
and there are many many chances.

412
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:08,248
How'd you do?

413
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,522
Don't... turn around

414
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,563
I managed.

415
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:20,128
You turned around.

416
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:22,970
What are you gonna do? Spank me?

417
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,127
I'm booted up. Go, Ethan.

418
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,849
Are you getting this?

419
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:11,208
Dr Sergei Gradski...

420
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:14,050
20 hours after exposure.

421
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:52,240
God...

422
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:05,043
Stamp's out of the loo.
He's heading your way, mate.

423
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:08,721
- I want you out of Ambrose's place.
- What did you see?

424
00:52:13,852 --> 00:52:15,922
Coming up behind you, Ethan.

425
00:52:15,972 --> 00:52:19,567
You've finished,
get out of Australia.

426
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:21,887
- 30 steps.
- How?

427
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:25,163
- 20, 19...
- Need to think it over?

428
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:27,646
15, 14, 12, 11...

429
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:29,728
Give me the earpiece.

430
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,569
Nine, Ethan, eight...

431
00:52:31,612 --> 00:52:35,571
If you don't get out,
I'll come and get you.

432
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,364
Ethan, get out of there.

433
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:41,763
You place your bet, ma'am?

434
00:52:43,652 --> 00:52:45,483
Just.

435
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:49,649
The stalls are filled.
Horses are ready to race!

436
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:02,925
Come on! The nag's
making a run for it! Come...

437
00:53:05,092 --> 00:53:06,571
Come on, come on!

438
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:13,288
You've picked another winner!

439
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:23,044
I thought you were going to dinner?

440
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:26,164
Hugh, take care
of the Nekhorvich memory card.

441
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:32,086
- Where is it?
- In the envelope in my jacket.

442
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:38,005
My right jacket pocket.

443
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:43,081
We at our solar-powered
Biocyte building,

444
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:46,124
recognise that eternal vigilance
is the price of health.

445
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:48,845
Whether funding teaching centres,

446
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,406
removing aerosol products
from the market

447
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:54,125
or braving the influenza quarantine
at Bruny island last month.

448
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:59,371
At Biocyte,
your life is our life's work.

449
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:03,531
We've got an opportunity here.

450
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:06,291
I'm not going to miss it.

451
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:37,260
George, take me home.

452
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:55,221
George...

453
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,141
George!

454
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:11,508
What the...?

455
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:33,302
Sean?

456
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:38,748
Sean!

457
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:21,380
Easy.

458
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:23,147
Ethan.

459
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:26,943
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I am now.

460
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:15,348
- What is this?
- A visit from an old friend.

461
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:20,546
You crashed on the plane.
You're dead.

462
00:57:20,589 --> 00:57:25,379
Tired, certainly,
but dead is a little extreme.

463
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:27,067
On the other hand,

464
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:32,183
when my colleague Gradski had
your pulse and your blood pressure

465
00:57:32,229 --> 00:57:34,902
he had less than a day to live.

466
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:41,421
You are infected with Chimera,
my friend.

467
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:46,459
No use, my friend,

468
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:50,218
the medical staff
wants no part of this.

469
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:53,579
Doctors don't like dying
more than anybody else.

470
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:56,143
How could I possibly be infected?

471
00:57:56,189 --> 00:58:00,580
That's exactly what Gradski said,
27 hours before he died.

472
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:04,827
You've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard,

473
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:06,939
you stole Bellerophon-all of it!

474
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:10,459
I need it. I need it now,
you wacked-out Russian gypsy!

475
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:15,424
And what about Gradski, who you
deliberately infected with Chimera?

476
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:18,859
How could I know they needed
Bellerophon within 20 hours?

477
00:58:18,909 --> 00:58:22,868
- By asking me.
- You still don't get it.

478
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:28,302
I needed to know just how bad
the disease was in the real world.

479
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:31,944
You were genetically splicing
strains of influenza

480
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,184
to create a cure for all influenzas.

481
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:38,507
But you were also creating a disease
so terrible in Chimera...

482
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:40,540
the cure would be priceless.

483
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:43,661
I needed Chimera
in order to peddle Bellerophon.

484
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,939
It's not that difficult
to understand.

485
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,902
Look, I've got the virus,
you've got the cure.

486
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,940
I need them both.

487
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:55,948
Time was a shot of penicillin
would knock off every bloody bug.

488
00:58:55,989 --> 00:58:58,184
Not any more.

489
00:58:58,229 --> 00:59:01,904
If I couldn't make money killing the
microscopic little shits out there

490
00:59:01,949 --> 00:59:04,588
you'd make one
that I could make money on.

491
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,265
Well, there it is, I've confessed.

492
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:15,066
I, John C McCloy,
am in business to make money.

493
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:20,224
Now, forget any deal you made
with that thug Ambrose,

494
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:23,818
get me treated
and let's go back to work.

495
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:25,985
You know,

496
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,817
I think it's a little late for that.

497
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:35,546
Do give my regards to Gradski -
if you see him.

498
00:59:46,109 --> 00:59:47,986
Well...

499
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:53,139
I've heard...

500
00:59:56,229 --> 00:59:58,345
all I need to hear.

501
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:02,905
Nyah...

502
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:06,305
it's imperative that we do nothing...

503
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:08,180
to alarm Ambrose.

504
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:12,098
What?

505
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:15,744
I thought you were here
to collect me! I was so relieved!

506
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:21,024
Listen to me.
There's no time to talk.

507
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:25,108
It is critical, absolutely critical,

508
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:29,427
that you do whatever Ambrose asks.

509
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,699
Do you understand me?

510
01:00:37,549 --> 01:00:39,380
Don't worry.

511
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:44,298
It'll all be over... very soon.

512
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,980
That's a promise.

513
01:00:57,989 --> 01:01:00,025
All right, off you go.

514
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:32,906
We know this -
Nekhorvich gets on a plane

515
01:01:32,949 --> 01:01:35,463
to go to the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta.

516
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:38,421
He's carrying a virus he created -
Chimera,

517
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:42,223
and a cure for that virus,
Bellerophon.

518
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:46,301
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

519
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,180
That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.

520
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:54,188
So we go into Biocyte,
kill Chimera...

521
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:58,586
Ambrose has a cure without a disease
and we're home free.

522
01:01:59,669 --> 01:02:04,106
You were right,
Hunt stung McCloy tonight.

523
01:02:04,149 --> 01:02:06,265
So he knows.

524
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,743
He'll be going into Biocyte.

525
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:14,380
Good. Then we know
where he'll be, don't we?

526
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:18,099
Well done, Hugh.

527
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:21,785
Well done.

528
01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:35,185
You're home, mate. Home.

529
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:42,059
Where's George?
My regular driver-where is he?

530
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:43,508
Gone home, sick. Touch of flu.

531
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,425
Is the building up and running?

532
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:54,986
That's not exactly it.

533
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:58,305
Sorry. This is
the Biocyte storage structure.

534
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:00,101
I'll have it in a minute.

535
01:03:02,189 --> 01:03:05,977
- Take a look at this.
- Start from the inside.

536
01:03:06,029 --> 01:03:09,101
All storage and production
of Chimera is done here -

537
01:03:09,149 --> 01:03:12,141
in this lab on the 42nd floor.

538
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:14,657
Hunt's target will be the Chimera,

539
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:18,861
stored and manufactured
at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.

540
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:23,903
If you look at Hunt's
operational history-and I have -

541
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:28,340
he invariably favours
misdirection over confrontation.

542
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:32,780
He'll never break in from the bottom
where security is heaviest.

543
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:34,740
No garage entrances,

544
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:38,338
Iobby's protected by five guards
on rotating patrol.

545
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,659
Not going in from the ground.
Show the atrium.

546
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:46,907
The atrium-one of a kind.

547
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,144
Runs through the centre
of the building,

548
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:54,502
provides 24-hour natural light via
mirrors and daylight storage cells.

549
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:58,542
Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.

550
01:04:03,229 --> 01:04:06,027
The atrium roof closes at sundown,

551
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:09,141
and if the louvers are up
for more than 40 seconds,

552
01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:13,102
the civil emergency alarms are
tripped. Those even I can't stop.

553
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:17,427
Ethan, that's 40 seconds
to get you in and the cables out.

554
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:22,187
No, Hunt will prefer to enter Biocyte

555
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:25,221
somewhere from the top
where security is minimal.

556
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:28,818
He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity

557
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:31,861
before he'll risk harming
a hair on a security guard's head.

558
01:04:45,669 --> 01:04:48,661
- Check-check, copy?
- You're five by five.

559
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:54,665
Luther, how we doing?

560
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:57,098
Not there yet.
I'll give you the word.

561
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,906
Billy, ready to go?

562
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:09,621
- Away in five...
- Louvers aren't moving!

563
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:13,548
- Come on, Luther.
- I'm punching the access code.

564
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,463
Luther, we're out of time.

565
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:28,546
Please, baby, open up. Open up...

566
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:30,705
Five... four...

567
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:33,058
- Come on!
...three... two...

568
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:34,622
- One!
- Down!

569
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,068
Ethan, wait!

570
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:14,100
25... 24... 23...

571
01:06:14,149 --> 01:06:17,983
22... 21... 20.

572
01:06:18,029 --> 01:06:21,260
Ethan, you've got 19 seconds
to clear the cable.

573
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,181
OK, retracting cable...

574
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:38,021
Come on!

575
01:06:39,069 --> 01:06:40,707
Nine... eight...

576
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:42,023
seven... six...

577
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:44,025
five... four...

578
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:45,422
two...

579
01:06:47,509 --> 01:06:48,908
Cable's clear!

580
01:07:02,229 --> 01:07:04,060
Transponder activated.

581
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:06,304
Reading package and cable clear.

582
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:16,584
He'll breach the lab
at the only possible time,

583
01:07:16,629 --> 01:07:19,701
whether breaking in
from the ground or the roof.

584
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:22,502
It's 2300 hours one minute.

585
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:26,019
When the air filtration generators
will cover the sound,

586
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:30,267
and the rotating guards make the
building vulnerable to us from below.

587
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:34,623
The generators are about to start.

588
01:07:34,669 --> 01:07:38,550
We'll be out of contact
for eight minutes.

589
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:12,069
I'm betting Hunt
will destroy Chimera,

590
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,863
not attempt
to preserve any part of it.

591
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:17,504
He'll have to do it in two places.

592
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:22,829
First, the incubation room
where the growth vials are kept.

593
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:27,788
And finally,
in the inoculation chamber,

594
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,664
holding the last remaining Chimera
virus in three injection guns.

595
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:37,103
He won't be allowed
to destroy the virus in those guns.

596
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,499
What's this? You're on time for once?

597
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,506
Not exactly, sport.

598
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,425
John C McCloy.

599
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,988
Billy, we've got a problem.

600
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:30,545
Nyah's on the wing up early.
Do you copy?

601
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,388
I got you, Luther. So where is she?

602
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:36,149
- In the building.
- Say again, mate.

603
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:38,624
Sounds like you're saying
"In the building."

604
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,309
I am. She is.

605
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,104
She's not likely to be alone,
is she, mate?

606
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:49,428
She's in the elevator
headed toward Ethan.

607
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,825
I can't get through to Ethan
till the generators stop.

608
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:55,943
- When's that?
- Another five and a half minutes.

609
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,863
Chimera in vitro pH
and temperature level

610
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:36,583
outside optimal range.

611
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,747
Chimera in vitro pH
and temperature level

612
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,020
outside optimal range.

613
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:46,348
Chimera working seed stock pH
at critical level.

614
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:49,746
Alert.
Chimera stock life threatened.

615
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:54,306
Alert.
Chimera stock life terminated.

616
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:01,821
Come on, Ethan, come on.

617
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,388
Subject is contaminant free.

618
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,990
Zero contaminant factor.

619
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,743
Come on, Ethan, come on.

620
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,458
Luther, what the hell can we do?

621
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,341
What can we do?

622
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:44,224
Hope he's finished before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.

623
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:37,266
However we travel,
I must arrive at my destination

624
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,301
within 20 hours of departure.

625
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:48,389
How could I know they needed
Bellerophon within 20 hours?

626
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,068
Get him.

627
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:36,786
How long before you can reach him?

628
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:41,540
29 seconds before the generators
turn off and Ethan's back on-line.

629
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,779
Luther! Luther?

630
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:01,228
Hold your fire!

631
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,340
Hold your fire, damn it!

632
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,579
Well, Hunt...

633
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,059
How you been?

634
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,900
Fighting a bit of a cold.

635
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:34,828
That was the hardest part
of portraying you...

636
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,464
grinning like an idiot
every 15 minutes.

637
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:43,381
Not that pressing need of yours
to get your gun off?

638
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:47,263
You were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747,

639
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,665
you never figured out
where Chimera really was.

640
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:52,144
I knew where it was.

641
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,148
You knew that the only way
Nekhorvich could smuggle it

642
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:59,706
was by injecting himself?
You knew that?

643
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:04,460
When you killed him-destroying
exactly what you came for.

644
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:13,108
Stop!

645
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,106
Put a sock in it!

646
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,863
Hit the gun and you'll spray
the virus everywhere!

647
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:23,701
There it is, guys.

648
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:27,062
The last of it.

649
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:31,301
- What was the top bid?
- Gonna make a better offer?

650
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:35,348
Than £37 million? Not really.

651
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:42,228
Somebody has been
slipping you our mail.

652
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:46,388
Come on out here, you bad girl.

653
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,700
Sean, she doesn't belong here.

654
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,581
Let her go.

655
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:08,546
She wouldn't be here...
if it wasn't for you, Hunt.

656
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:19,861
From this moment, you are responsible
for what happens to her,

657
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:22,663
and if you're looking out
for her well-being,

658
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,508
then advise her
to pick up the injection gun

659
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,189
and bring it to me.

660
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:30,824
Ball's in your court, Hunt.

661
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:39,182
Nyah's in the building.

662
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:41,505
Do you copy?

663
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:43,909
Thank you.

664
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,864
He could shoot you once he's got it.

665
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,061
Please, one can't hold Nyah
responsible for our actions.

666
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:07,180
You know women, mate.

667
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:09,300
Like monkeys, they are.

668
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,899
Won't let go of one branch
till they grab the next.

669
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,623
Get it, Nyah. I'll cover you.

670
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,706
I am waiting.

671
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:06,548
Things haven't worked out
the way you thought, Ethan.

672
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,699
Sorry.

673
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,467
Bitch!

674
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,500
You're not gonna shoot me, Sean!
Not this bitch.

675
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:49,020
Cause she's worth £37 million.

676
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:23,184
- What do you think you're doing?
- I wasn't thinking!

677
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:26,540
Just trying to stop you
from getting hurt, that's all.

678
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:29,343
You who don't have a conscience?

679
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,745
I guess I lied.

680
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,584
You can't get us both out, can you?

681
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,541
I'm infected with Chimera,
you know you don't have a choice.

682
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:17,660
Just do it.

683
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,907
Do it! Now!

684
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:42,789
We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes.

685
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:45,503
We'll get Bellerophon
into you before then.

686
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:52,580
Just stay alive!
I'm not going to lose you!

687
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,820
Feel like pleading for your life?

688
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:10,857
Well, then, how about dying -

689
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:14,263
so you can make me a lot of money?

690
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:22,336
In just a few hours time

691
01:23:22,387 --> 01:23:24,696
you can be assured
of going down in history

692
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:28,103
as a Typhoid Mary of Oz.

693
01:23:28,147 --> 01:23:29,819
G'day.

694
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:36,817
There's no chance of locating Nyah
until I access the satellite.

695
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:40,337
And I can't do that
until I can fix this computer.

696
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:42,582
How much time does she have?

697
01:23:42,627 --> 01:23:46,256
Not long, but whatever happens,
Nyah will take care of Nyah.

698
01:23:46,307 --> 01:23:47,945
What do you mean?

699
01:23:47,987 --> 01:23:51,218
Without Bellerophon
Nyah will kill herself.

700
01:23:51,267 --> 01:23:53,303
So first things first.

701
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:50,626
Ambrose and his team have arrived,
and Nyah's not with him.

702
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:51,816
Copy that.

703
01:24:59,267 --> 01:25:01,098
You all right, mate?

704
01:25:01,147 --> 01:25:03,786
Looks like pretty heavy security.

705
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:05,624
What's it like from there?

706
01:25:07,347 --> 01:25:09,099
Risky.

707
01:26:24,107 --> 01:26:25,540
Simon?

708
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,022
Simon?

709
01:26:27,067 --> 01:26:29,103
Stay here.

710
01:26:44,587 --> 01:26:46,703
Breached the structure
at the grating.

711
01:26:58,907 --> 01:27:02,263
It's a DNA match,
the blood's loaded with Chimera.

712
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:13,097
And they certainly have Bellerophon.

713
01:27:15,587 --> 01:27:19,660
You've got them both, which
means I've got 30 million for you.

714
01:27:19,707 --> 01:27:21,379
Not exactly.

715
01:27:21,427 --> 01:27:25,056
- We don't want just cash.
- What do you want?

716
01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:28,543
Stock, Mr McCloy.

717
01:27:28,587 --> 01:27:32,023
Stock options,
to be a little more precise.

718
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:43,138
Cut her loose,
right in the centre of town.

719
01:27:43,187 --> 01:27:45,178
The more crowded the better.

720
01:27:46,987 --> 01:27:51,424
Ethan, Nyah's been dropped off.
I think she's still alive.

721
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:53,537
- Where?
- Somewhere in Sydney.

722
01:28:04,347 --> 01:28:06,577
Care to harden the target?

723
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:10,984
I can't until I can get the GPS up.

724
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:15,541
The clock is ticking.

725
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:18,181
How quickly
can you manufacture anti-virus?

726
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:20,457
No time at all, once I've got it.

727
01:28:20,507 --> 01:28:24,546
Good. Biocyte stock
is about to go through the roof.

728
01:28:24,587 --> 01:28:26,817
- What?
- An outbreak of Chimera.

729
01:28:26,867 --> 01:28:30,701
- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.

730
01:28:30,747 --> 01:28:34,422
You create the supply, Mr McCloy,
we've just created the demand.

731
01:28:34,467 --> 01:28:38,380
3 million people in Sydney
and 17 million in Australia

732
01:28:38,427 --> 01:28:41,225
will need Bellerophon
within the next few days.

733
01:28:41,267 --> 01:28:43,417
Not to mention the world.

734
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:45,503
This is how it's going to work.

735
01:28:45,547 --> 01:28:48,300
- Shares outstanding are...?
- 93.4 million.

736
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:52,943
Which means, Mr McCloy,
we need 480,000 options.

737
01:28:52,987 --> 01:28:55,945
We'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.

738
01:28:55,987 --> 01:28:59,582
Your stock has never
sold above $31 a share.

739
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:03,745
When your stock goes north of 200,
which... it will,

740
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:06,221
those options will be worth billions

741
01:29:06,267 --> 01:29:10,977
and I will own 51%/o of Biocyte.

742
01:29:11,027 --> 01:29:13,382
This is outrageous,

743
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:16,578
I will not let you
take control of my company.

744
01:29:16,627 --> 01:29:19,221
Sit down.

745
01:29:57,107 --> 01:30:00,258
You'll be a billionaire,
which is better than being broke.

746
01:30:00,307 --> 01:30:03,060
I have terrorists
and other pharmaceutical companies

747
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:04,506
standing in line.

748
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:12,737
The ball's in your court, Mr McCloy.

749
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:08,340
Run that bastard down.

750
01:31:22,187 --> 01:31:25,816
We're running short on time,
Mr McCloy.

751
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:28,540
We have got to conclude our business.

752
01:31:30,147 --> 01:31:33,696
Yes. Start the transfer.

753
01:31:39,347 --> 01:31:42,544
Follow it... and let me know.

754
01:32:48,987 --> 01:32:51,137
Raise your hands very slowly.

755
01:32:51,187 --> 01:32:53,382
Sure you want me to?

756
01:32:54,587 --> 01:32:57,784
Raise your hands very slowly.

757
01:33:29,707 --> 01:33:32,665
Ethan, do you copy?

758
01:33:37,547 --> 01:33:39,856
Keep it going.

759
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:50,706
Sean, this rat's
reached the end of the maze.

760
01:33:51,707 --> 01:33:56,064
- Is he alive?
- Yah, more or less.

761
01:33:57,987 --> 01:33:59,943
Bring him to me.

762
01:33:59,987 --> 01:34:01,500
Go.

763
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:10,581
Sean, transfer completed.

764
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:32,584
Well done, Stamp.

765
01:34:32,627 --> 01:34:33,776
Well done.

766
01:34:51,947 --> 01:34:54,017
Stop mumbling!

767
01:34:54,067 --> 01:34:58,663
Afraid he's got no choice,
I believe I broke his jaw.

768
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:02,101
Stamp, I'm impressed.

769
01:35:02,147 --> 01:35:04,786
We don't have much time, Hunt,

770
01:35:04,827 --> 01:35:07,182
whatever you've got to say,
say it now.

771
01:35:09,267 --> 01:35:12,179
How about giving us a big smile?

772
01:35:15,027 --> 01:35:18,656
- No?
- What are you doing?

773
01:35:18,707 --> 01:35:22,256
Get down on your knees.

774
01:35:24,747 --> 01:35:30,663
Now... this is what's known
as getting your gun off.

775
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,709
There he is!

776
01:36:50,312 --> 01:36:51,631
Ethan!

777
01:37:07,272 --> 01:37:09,502
Just back up
and pinpoint her position!

778
01:38:05,632 --> 01:38:07,782
Luther! Clear the bridge for me!

779
01:38:11,992 --> 01:38:15,507
Hunt's heading for the bridge,
12 o'clock high.

780
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,869
I'm mad now.

781
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,709
- All right?
- Punk put a hole in my Versace!

782
01:40:44,952 --> 01:40:47,307
Ethan, the computer's up.
I've got Nyah.

783
01:40:47,352 --> 01:40:51,265
She's out of the city - North Head
Bluff, approaching the cliffs.

784
01:40:51,312 --> 01:40:55,988
- I can't get a visual.
- She's got little time left!

785
01:40:56,032 --> 01:40:58,182
Track ahead and pick her up!

786
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:09,188
- I can't get a good shot.
- We can't cover you.

787
01:41:09,232 --> 01:41:13,908
My earpiece is failing! You've got
me on GPS, bring her to me!

788
01:41:22,592 --> 01:41:24,867
Billy, North Head Bluff-haul ass!

789
01:41:50,792 --> 01:41:54,023
- Keep firing!
- I can't see anything!

790
01:41:54,072 --> 01:41:55,744
Slow down! Slow down!

791
01:43:51,712 --> 01:43:53,543
Range is two K.

792
01:47:18,832 --> 01:47:22,108
Go ahead. Use it, Hunt.

793
01:47:22,152 --> 01:47:24,666
It's not a bad way to go.

794
01:47:24,712 --> 01:47:27,784
A lot better than the way
that bitch is gonna die!

795
01:48:12,912 --> 01:48:14,868
There she is!

796
01:50:14,429 --> 01:50:16,260
Hunt!

797
01:50:19,349 --> 01:50:22,227
You should've killed me!

798
01:51:57,989 --> 01:52:01,948
Miss Hall's blood has
no elements of the Chimera virus.

799
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:04,583
Not even antibodies.

800
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:07,097
Yes, I gathered as much.

801
01:52:07,149 --> 01:52:09,504
But you were under instructions

802
01:52:09,549 --> 01:52:12,666
to bring back a living sample
of the Chimera virus.

803
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:16,258
I'd be interested to know how,
after you managed this recovery,

804
01:52:16,309 --> 01:52:19,267
it subsequently got destroyed.

805
01:52:19,309 --> 01:52:22,346
By fire. It's the best way.

806
01:52:25,349 --> 01:52:29,467
Well, as for Miss Hall,
in light of her... efforts

807
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:33,422
her criminal record
will certainly be expunged.

808
01:52:33,469 --> 01:52:36,859
Wiped out. I'm assuming you approve?

809
01:52:39,829 --> 01:52:41,547
I do.

810
01:52:41,589 --> 01:52:44,740
Where is she now, by the way?
Any idea?

811
01:52:45,829 --> 01:52:48,218
I don't know. Not exactly.

812
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:51,420
So what are your plans?

813
01:52:51,469 --> 01:52:55,382
I don't know. Some sort of vacation.

814
01:52:55,429 --> 01:52:58,023
I'll let you know where I'm going.

815
01:52:58,069 --> 01:53:00,663
You don't have to do that.

816
01:53:00,709 --> 01:53:03,507
It wouldn't be a vacation
if you did.

817
01:53:51,389 --> 01:53:54,028
Let's get lost.
